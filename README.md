Step 6: Conclusion
In this analysis, we explored a dataset comprising employment outcomes of engineering graduates, covering salary, job titles, job cities, educational background, and personality traits. The following key findings were observed:

Salary Distribution: The average salary across the dataset is ₹307,700, with salaries ranging from ₹35,000 to ₹4,000,000. A majority of salaries are clustered in the ₹180,000 - ₹370,000 range.
Gender Imbalance: Males outnumber females in the dataset, with 76% male and 24% female representation. This imbalance is reflected across job roles and cities.
Personality Traits and Salary: Analysis of personality traits like conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and openness to experience showed no significant correlation with salary, indicating that other factors, such as technical skills and job roles, may play a more significant role in salary determination.
Education and Salary: College GPA and percentages in 10th and 12th grades show a moderate positive correlation with salary, suggesting that academic performance is a good indicator of future salary potential. Additionally, higher-tier colleges generally offer better salary prospects.
Location Insights: Cities such as Bangalore, Chennai, and Gurgaon are leading hubs for engineering graduates, offering a wide range of job opportunities and generally higher salary packages.
Step 7: Bonus - Interesting Conclusions and Research Questions
Gender Salary Discrepancy: Further investigation into gender pay gaps across various roles could yield insights into whether salary disparities exist between male and female graduates and which job titles show the most disparity.

Regional Salary Differences: Do certain cities consistently offer higher salaries across the same roles? Analyzing salary differences based on job cities could help identify regional job markets offering the best pay.

Effect of Specialization: How does engineering specialization influence job outcomes and salary? Exploring the correlation between specific engineering branches (e.g., mechanical, computer science, electronics) and salary can help graduates make more informed decisions about career paths.

Influence of Personality Traits: Can personality traits predict job satisfaction or career longevity? While traits like extraversion and conscientiousness didn’t show a direct link to salary, their impact on job satisfaction or career progression could be explored.

Salary Growth Over Time: What is the expected salary growth trajectory for engineering graduates over their careers? A longitudinal study could be conducted to track salary progression based on initial job titles, cities, and education levels.

These research questions can guide deeper investigations into factors influencing employment outcomes, particularly for engineering graduates in India.
